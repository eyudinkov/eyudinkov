# What can I say about myself?

I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. Iâ€™m not comfortable with settling, and Iâ€™m always looking for an opportunity to do better.

# My hobbies

Since childhood, I like to draw and design digital products. When I studied at university I worked as a designer and created game concepts for different clients from around the world. I also like hiking and open-air activities. Sometimes I like to create electronic music and mixes.

# My primary skils

Listed below are the tools and technologies that I use and I'm knowledgeable with.

1. Javascript and CSS
2. Angular
3. Reactjs
4. Svelte
5. Nodejs
6. Nest
7. Flutter
8. React Native
9. Python

I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. Whatâ€™s really crucial for me when starting one is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I also like dealing with the most difficult parts of the projects early onâ€”that way in case there are any significant issues, Iâ€™ll still have a nice amount of time to complete before the deadline. I also typically break down large tasks into smaller chunks, so that it is easier to know where to start. Detailed planning is very important to ensure an important project goes smoothly.
