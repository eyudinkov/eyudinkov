I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. Iâ€™ve gained my major experience working on B2B and B2C projects and contributing to the growth of unique tech companies. I enjoy developing solutions that make products and services work for the right audiences. Whatâ€™s really crucial for me when starting a project is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I think detailed planning is very important to ensure a project goes smoothly.
