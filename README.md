# What can I say about myself?

I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. Iâ€™m not comfortable with settling, and Iâ€™m always looking for an opportunity to do better.

# My hobbies

When I am not writing code or writing about writing code, I enjoy traveling, detective movies and drawing. I also like hiking and open-air activities. I also like hiking and open-air activities. Sometimes I like to create electronic music and mixes.

I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. Whatâ€™s really crucial for me when starting one is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I also like dealing with the most difficult parts of the projects early onâ€”that way in case there are any significant issues, Iâ€™ll still have a nice amount of time to complete before the deadline. I also typically break down large tasks into smaller chunks, so that it is easier to know where to start. I think detailed planning is very important to ensure an important project goes smoothly. 

In addition to my main job, I also work as a teacher, article writer, and open source
contributor. Here is a couple of links you might be interested in:
